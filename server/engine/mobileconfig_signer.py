"""
iOS Configuration Profile (.mobileconfig) CMS signer.

Signs a raw XML plist with an SSL certificate so iOS shows the signer's domain
instead of the red "未签名 / Unsigned" warning. This is the technical basis
of what Chinese distributors call "苹果免签" — it's really just a properly
signed WebClip payload.

iOS verifies signatures against the public root CA store, so any cert from a
public CA (Let's Encrypt, Sectigo, DigiCert, ...) works. Self-signed certs
won't — they'll be accepted as unsigned, the same as no signing at all.

Signing is implemented by shelling out to `openssl cms`, which is present on
every macOS/Linux server and avoids pulling in the pyca/cryptography dependency.
If openssl or cert files are missing, signing is skipped gracefully and the
unsigned payload is returned — every iOS version still accepts it.
